# Aerial drone photography project

# General information
* Author : Balthazar Neveu

# Demo content
Run [demo.py](demo.py) to test the image processing features.

## I/O management
* [irdrone.process](irdrone/process.py) contains helpers
  * load images from disk
  * compare images in a side by side or grid fashion
  
```
import irdrone.process as pr
import irdrone.utils   as ut
pr.show(
    [
        [(ut.testimage(xsize=200, ysize=200, sat=sat ), "color rectangle %.1f"%sat) for sat in [0.1, 0.5]],
        [(ut.testimage(xsize=300, ysize=200, sat=sat), "wide %.1f"%sat) for sat in [0.3, 0.5, 1.]]
    ],
    suptitle="Comparison grid"

# Image processing pipeline
[irdrone.imagepipe.Imagepipe](irdrone/imagepipe.py) class is designed to build a simple image processing pipeline
* multiple inputs support
* configured through parameters which can be tuned with GUI sliders
* use the `.gui()` method to launch interactive tuning
* when the GUI is launched, you can use 
    * `S` to save the current image at full resolution
    * `I` to print the current tuning parameters values
    * `Q` to close the window
    * `R` to reset the parameters

Simple language is used to describe the sequence of processings.
### Example
```
imgl = [utils.testimage(xsize=720, ysize=720),]
ipBasicLinPipe = imagepipe.ImagePipe(
    imgl,
    sliders=[imagepipe.BRIGHTNESS, imagepipe.WB, imagepipe.GAMMA],
).gui()
```

Will create an image processing pipeline where first, 
* all channels can first be amplified through the brightness slider.
* then white balance can be applied (separate multiplications on blue and red channels)
* and finally a gamma tone curve is applied

```puml
@startuml 
Image_1->Image_0 : initalization [float conversion]
Image_0->Image_0: BRIGHTNESS
Image_0->Image_0: WB
Image_0->Image_0: GAMMA
Image_0->Output : output [8 bit conversion]

```

### Multi-image processing
```
TRANSLATION2 = Translation("T_IMAGE2", slidersName=["TX im2", "TY im2"], inputs=[2,], outputs=[2,], vrange=(-50.,50.,0.))
imgl = [utils.testimage(xsize=720, ysize=720, sat=sat) for sat in [1., 0.]]
ip = ImagePipe(imgl, sliders=[WB, TRANSLATION2, ALPHA, GAMMA]).gui()
```
* `imagelist[0]` is used for recursive processing.
* Take a careful look at the instanciation of `TRANSLATION2` , `inputs=[2,], outputs=[2,]` are given in order to select 
  which images to apply the processingBlock to and where to redirect the output.
  

```puml
@startuml 
Image_1->Image_0: initialization [float conversion]
Image_0<-Image_0: WB
Image_2->Image_2: TRANSLATION2
Image_0<-Image_0: x (alpha) x Image0
Image_0<-Image_2: + (1-alpha) x Image2
Image_0->Image_0 : GAMMA
Image_0 -> Output : output [8 bit]
@enduml
```
